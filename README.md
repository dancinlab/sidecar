> **A sidecar that bolts guardrails onto Claude Code without touching the host.**
> Not hand-rolled hook snippets — the guard set proven in production by the
> hexa-native agent [`wilson`](https://github.com/dancinlab/wilson), ported to
> the Claude Code plugin marketplace.

`sidecar` is a **plugin marketplace repo** that side-mounts governance onto the
host harness (Claude Code) without modifying it. It maps the value of wilson's
`governance` / `guard-*` / `agents-md` plugins onto Claude Code's hook
primitives 1:1.

## Why sidecar?

- **Ported, proven guards** — not an ad-hoc dotfiles hook pile, but denial
  rules battle-tested in the wilson bundle (dangerous-path, SSOT append-only,
  domain-lint).
- **Non-invasive to the host** — no edits to Claude Code config or core.
  Install / enable / disable from the marketplace only.
- **A wilson on-ramp** — taste wilson's governance inside Claude Code, then
  graduate to full `wilson` (hexa-native, plugin-everything).

## Plugins

| Plugin | CC hook | Behavior |
|---|---|---|
| `wilson-guards` | `PreToolUse` (`Write`·`Edit`·`MultiEdit`) | Three dancinlab-workflow guards in one bundle — `ssot-lock` (deny editing a file matched by an `ssot-lock:` bullet in the nearest `AGENTS.md ## Governance`), `tape-append-only` (a `.log.tape` event history is append-only — deny a rewriting Edit / overwriting Write; per the tape v1.2 architecture-vs-history split a plain `.tape` is editable architecture, so the guard is inert for it), `domain-lint` (a root `UPPERCASE.md` topic roadmap must be `Head + --- + ## Log`) — standalone port, **working**; each guard inert unless its convention is present (opt out: `SIDECAR_NO_GUARDS=1`) |
| `wilson-ssot` | `SessionStart` · `UserPromptSubmit` | Inject `AGENTS.md` walk-up SSOT as context (wilson `agents-md` equivalent) — **working** |
| `wilson-readme-format` | `PreToolUse` (`Write`·`Edit`) | Deny a repo-root `README.md` violating readme-format anti-patterns (emoji-in-prose / multi-glyph H1 / non-English At-a-glance / `####`) — standalone port of wilson `guard-readme-format`, **working** |
| `wilson-hexa-verify` | `PreToolUse` + `PostToolUse` (`Bash`) | PreToolUse: deny Bash invocations of non-hexa verifiers (sympy / PyPhi / wolframscript / mathematica) → redirect to the hexa CLI. PostToolUse: when `hexa verify` reports a new SUPPORTED equation (🔵/🟢), **opens a PR** to `dancinlab/hexa-lang` baking the equation into the binary built-in atlas (fills `hexa atlas promote`'s stubbed `pr` step; PR left for human review, never auto-merged) — falls back to prompting the `worktree-pr` workflow if the autonomous PR isn't possible. Standalone port + extension of wilson `guard-hexa-verify`, **working**. ⚠ INERT unless `hexa` is on PATH |
| `wilson-dangerous-path` | `PreToolUse` (`Write`·`Edit`) | Deny Write/Edit/MultiEdit targeting a protected system path (`/etc` `/usr` `/bin` `/sbin` `/System` `/.git` `/.gnupg`) or a credential path (`~/.ssh`, `~/.aws`, gh config, keychain, credentials) — standalone port of wilson `guard-dangerous-path`, **working** |
| `wilson-git-guard` | `PreToolUse` (`Bash`) | Deny force-push — a `git push` carrying `--force` / `-f` / a `+refspec` (and `--force-with-lease` unless `SIDECAR_ALLOW_FORCE_WITH_LEASE=1`) is blocked — standalone port of wilson `git-guard`, **working** |
| `wilson-secret-guard` | `PreToolUse` (`Write`/`Edit`/`MultiEdit`) + `UserPromptSubmit` | Deny writing a real `.env` file or content carrying a high-confidence credential (AWS / GitHub / GitLab / Anthropic / OpenAI / Slack / Google / Stripe tokens, PEM private keys); block a prompt that pastes one — high-confidence patterns only, near-zero false positives, **working** (opt out: `SIDECAR_NO_SECRET_GUARD=1`) |
| `wilson-bash-guard` | `PreToolUse` (`Bash`) | Deny catastrophic shell commands — pipe-to-shell (`curl … \| sh`), `rm -rf` of a root/home path, fork bombs, disk destroyers (`dd of=/dev/disk`, `mkfs`, `>/dev/sd*`), recursive `chmod`/`chown` on `/` `~` `.` — high-confidence destructive patterns only, near-zero false positives, **working** (opt out: `SIDECAR_NO_BASH_GUARD=1`) |
| `wilson-prefs` | `/wilson-prefs:prefs` command + `SessionStart`·`UserPromptSubmit` | Set reply language / code language / response style — language values accept `auto` (mirror the language the user writes in); persisted to plugin data, injected as context. Standalone port of wilson `prefs` — **working** (injects nothing until you set one) |
| `wilson-output-trim` | `PreToolUse` (`Bash`) | Rewrites a Bash command (`updatedInput`) so stdout passes a TF-IDF salience + MinHash near-dup filter before the model ingests it — spirit-port of wilson `compaction-prefilter`, **working** (small output verbatim; exit code preserved via `pipefail`) |
| `wilson-pool` | `/wilson-pool:pool` command + `PreToolUse` (`Bash`) + `SessionStart`·`UserPromptSubmit` | Route heavy Bash commands to a remote **host roster** via ssh — each host is platform-tagged, so a macOS-only / Linux-only command goes to a host of that platform and the rest is round-robined — spirit-port of wilson's `pool` roster, **working**. ⚠ OFF until the roster has ≥1 host + workdir set (`workdir auto` mirrors the current project across hosts); only Bash is routed; **you** keep the remote workdir synced on every host (a CC hook can't mount the fs like wilson's 9P/sshfs) |
| `wilson-checkpoint` | `Stop`·`PreCompact`·`SessionEnd`·`SessionStart` | Never lose work to a usage limit / crash — every turn, `git stash create` snapshots WIP (a dangling commit; working tree / index / branches untouched), pinned under `refs/wilson-checkpoint/`, + a resume note; `SessionStart` re-injects an unconsumed snapshot. `/wilson-checkpoint:checkpoint` to status/restore/clear (restore is printed, never auto-applied) — **working**, git-only, debounced (opt out: `SIDECAR_NO_CHECKPOINT=1`) |
| `wilson-gpu` | `/wilson-gpu` command + `SessionStart` | Rented-GPU cost guardrail for RunPod / Vast.ai — `SessionStart` surfaces every still-billing instance (uptime + ~cost so far) so a forgotten pod never leaks money; `down` is the kill switch, `attach` wires an instance into the `wilson-pool` roster. Strategies `watch`/`budget`/`idle-reaper`/`ephemeral`; money & auto-down are double-gated by separate off-by-default switches (`provisioning`+`--yes` for `up`, `reaping` for auto-stop); `fanout` = cost-tolerance decision aid for shardable jobs. **working**, inert unless `runpodctl`/`vastai` on PATH (opt out: `SIDECAR_NO_GPU=1`) |
| `wilson-decision-gate` | `SessionStart` · `UserPromptSubmit` + `/wilson-decision-gate` | Step-by-step decision gate — multi-decision work is **one user-confirmation gate per decision, never batched** (options + recommendation + 3+ rationale → wait for the pick → next), logged as a `### Decision N` block in `design.md`. Standalone port of wilson's `step-by-step-decision-gate` (text-only, like wilson). `SessionStart` injects the principle once; `UserPromptSubmit` adds a short reminder **only on branch-point-looking prompts** (not every prompt). `/wilson-decision-gate decide\|log\|on\|off\|sample`; ships a 5-language canonical sample — **working**, default ON (opt out: `SIDECAR_NO_DECISION_GATE=1`) |
| `wilson-fire-gate` | `SessionStart`·`PostCompact` · `UserPromptSubmit` + `/wilson-fire-gate` | Instrument-first decision gate — **measure over predict**. A *fire* = running one real measurement (benchmark / profile / probe) instead of predicting its outcome. At a measure-vs-predict fork: predict first with the most faithful model (prior measurements, roofline limits, documented walls); fire only when genuinely uncertain; never re-fire a settled result (resolve analytically, $0); `cost-no-object` frees a *needed* fire, it doesn't license firing a known answer. Each fork is gated and logged as a `### Fire-decision N` block in `design.md`. `SessionStart`/`PostCompact` inject the principle; `UserPromptSubmit` reminds only on measurement-looking prompts. Companion to `wilson-decision-gate` (generic gate) — this one is measurement-specialized — **working**, default ON (opt out: `SIDECAR_NO_FIRE_GATE=1`) |
| `wilson-tape-recorder` | `SessionStart`·`UserPromptSubmit`·`PreToolUse`·`PostToolUse`·`SessionEnd` + `/wilson-tape-recorder` | Records the Claude Code session as a `.tape` v1.2 execution trace (the dancinlab `tape` format) — one file per session under `<DATA>/sessions/<id>.tape`: SessionStart `@S start` · UserPromptSubmit `@U` · PreToolUse `@T` · PostToolUse `@R` · SessionEnd `@S end`. Honest subset of the 17-type alphabet — only what CC hooks actually deliver (no `@A` assistant text, no `@K` cost — those signals aren't exposed). Pairs with `wilson-guards/tape-append-only` (the recorder **produces** `.tape`, the guard **protects** it). `/wilson-tape-recorder status\|ls\|tail\|cat\|on\|off` — **working**, default ON (opt out: `SIDECAR_NO_TAPE_RECORDER=1`) |
| `wilson-goal` | `SessionStart`·`UserPromptSubmit` + `/wilson-goal` | Session goal persistence + re-injection — keep the high-level objective alive across a long session and context compaction. Goal lives on disk at `<DATA>/goal.json` (outside the transcript that gets compacted), restored at every `SessionStart` and re-asserted as a one-line reminder on each `UserPromptSubmit` (≤ 180 B). A project-local `GOAL.md` is used as the default when no user goal is set. `/wilson-goal set\|status\|show\|clear\|path` — **working**, default ON. **Honest gap vs wilson `loop`**: only goal-persistence half is portable; autonomous continuation (wilson's `loop_tick`+QUEUE) needs no CC hook (opt out: `SIDECAR_NO_GOAL=1`) |
| `wilson-resume` | `Stop`·`SessionStart` + `/wilson-resume` | Persistence + re-arm companion for Claude Code's **native `/goal`** command (CC v2.1.139+). Native `/goal` is session-scoped with **no disk persistence** — a hard interruption (usage limit / crash / a closed terminal never cleanly `--resume`d) loses the completion condition, and the next session has no idea a goal was active. `wilson-resume` is the small cog that closes that gap: every `Stop` scans the transcript for the most recent `/goal` command and persists the condition to a per-project file; a bare `/goal` (the native clear) drops it. `SessionStart` (startup / clear — `resume` carries the native goal over) injects a `## Goal — interrupted` block with the exact `/goal <condition>` line to re-arm. Inert unless a `/goal` was used — **working**, default ON (opt out: `SIDECAR_NO_RESUME=1`) |
| `wilson-inbox` | `SessionStart` + `/wilson-inbox:inbox` | Cross-project handoff inbox — when a gap or request affects another SSOT repo, file it there as a structured `inbox/<kind>/<slug>.md` entry (kind: `notes`/`patches`/`poc`/`rfc_drafts`) instead of silently working around it downstream. `/wilson-inbox:inbox` scaffolds and manages entries — `add`/`list`/`show`/`path`/`verify`/`apply`/`archive`/`rm`; target repo is `--to <name>` (`~/core/<name>`) or the nearest `.git` from the cwd. Light-mode is folder + entries; heavy-mode adds `inbox/PATCHES.yaml` with a status lifecycle `apply`/`archive` transition. `SessionStart` surfaces the current repo's inbox entries so a handoff is never forgotten — **working**, inert unless the repo has an `inbox/` (opt out: `SIDECAR_NO_INBOX=1`) |
| `wilson-lsp` | `.lsp.json` LSP servers (not a hook) | Wires `.hexa` → `hexa lsp` and `.tape`·`.n6`·`.hxc`·`.kosmos` → the canonical per-repo servers (`tape-lsp`/`n6-lsp`/`hxc-lsp`/`kosmos-lsp`, shipped in `github.com/dancinlab/{tape,n6,hxc,kosmos}`). Graceful — a server not on PATH just shows in `/plugin` Errors. LSP lifecycle is CC-managed (toggle via `/plugin`, not `/sidecar`) |
| `sidecar` | `/sidecar` command (control) | Runtime on/off for the other plugins — `/sidecar status\|on\|off <name>` (names: ssot readme-format hexa-verify dangerous-path git-guard secret-guard bash-guard prefs output-trim pool checkpoint gpu decision-gate tape-recorder goal resume inbox guards fire-gate, or `all`). Shared `~/.claude/sidecar/disabled.json` each plugin's hook checks; persists across sessions; complements the native `/plugin` manager |
| `worktree-pr` | `/worktree-pr:wt` command (workflow) | Safe **worktree → PR → merge → cleanup** workflow — `start <name>` (isolated worktree+branch off origin's default), `ship <name> "<title>"` (push + open PR), `finish <name>` (merge PR + remove worktree + delete branch + refresh base), `status`, `abort`. Never touches the main working tree or a concurrent session's branch |
| `wilson-gap` | `/gap` command (model-facing) | Multi-axis gap exploration — `/gap` sweeps the current work through **40 breakthrough-strategy lenses** in 8 families, curated from the archived `hive` repo's `state/*_audit` catalogue (each lens = one probing one-liner). Bare `/gap` = mode C (inline-triage all 40 → deep-dive subagent only for each family that surfaced a gap; zero gaps spawns nothing); `/gap full` = mode A (fan-out one subagent per family, no triage); `/gap <text>` scopes the sweep; `/gap list` prints the catalogue. Surfaces and prioritises gaps only — never fixes. No hook, no bin script — pure model-facing command |

Roadmap candidates: `wilson-memory` (SessionStart/SessionEnd file memory),
`wilson-recap` (PreCompact/SessionEnd summarization).

Browse or toggle plugins anytime with `/plugin`. After a new release, upgrade with:

```bash
/plugin marketplace update sidecar
/plugin update
```

### Enable everything at once

Rather than running `/plugin install` per plugin, declare the marketplace and
the plugins in `settings.json` (`~/.claude/settings.json` for every project, or
`.claude/settings.json` for one) — Claude Code installs and enables every listed
plugin on the next start:

```json

  "extraKnownMarketplaces": {
    "sidecar": { "source": { "source": "github", "repo": "dancinlab/sidecar" } }
  },

## Status

**v0.1.0 — seventeen plugins working.** `wilson-guards` (ssot-lock /
tape-append-only / domain-lint bundle, inert unless its convention is
present), `wilson-ssot` (AGENTS.md walk-up),
`wilson-readme-format` (4-lint README guard, faithful standalone port of
wilson's `guard-readme-format`), `wilson-hexa-verify` (non-hexa-verifier
Bash guard, inert without `hexa`), `wilson-dangerous-path` (protected
system / credential path guard), `wilson-git-guard` (force-push guard),
`wilson-secret-guard` (block live secrets / `.env` writes / pasted
credentials), `wilson-bash-guard` (deny pipe-to-shell, `rm -rf /`, fork
bombs, disk destroyers), `wilson-prefs` (`/wilson-prefs:prefs`
slash command → persisted language/style, injected as context),
`wilson-output-trim` (Bash stdout → TF-IDF/MinHash salience filter via
`PreToolUse updatedInput`), `wilson-pool` (heavy Bash → a
platform-tagged remote host roster, user-synced workdir), and
`wilson-checkpoint` (every-turn `git stash create` WIP snapshot so a
usage limit / crash never loses work), and `wilson-gpu` (RunPod/Vast
rented-GPU cost guardrail + kill switch; provisioning behind a separate
off-by-default switch), and `wilson-decision-gate` (step-by-step
decision gate — one user-confirmation gate per decision, never batched;
`design.md` ledger; default ON, quiet), and `wilson-tape-recorder`
(records each session as a `.tape` v1.2 execution trace — `@S`/`@U`/`@T`
/`@R` — pairs with `wilson-guards/tape-append-only`), and `wilson-goal`
(persist the session's high-level objective on disk so it survives
compaction; re-injected at SessionStart, re-asserted compactly on each
prompt; project `GOAL.md` as default), and `wilson-inbox` (cross-project
handoff inbox — scaffold `inbox/<kind>/<slug>.md` entries in any SSOT
repo, `SessionStart` surfaces pending ones) **work**, plus
`wilson-lsp` (wires LSP — `.hexa`
via `hexa lsp`; `.tape`/`.n6`/`.hxc`/`.kosmos` via the canonical per-repo
servers) and the `sidecar` **control plugin**
(`/sidecar off <name>` toggles any of them at runtime, persists,
complements `/plugin`). `wilson-guards` is now a **standalone port** —
its three guards (`ssot-lock` / `tape-append-only` / `domain-lint`)
re-implement the wilson predicates directly, with no wilson binary
dependency. Each guard is **inert unless its convention is present** in
the project (no `ssot-lock:` bullet / no `.tape` file / no root topic
roadmap → zero behaviour), so the bundle is safe for general use and is
only meaningful inside a dancinlab-style workflow.
