description: /cycle-full — depletion brainstorm before cycle, then auto-continue to depletion. Runs iterative brainstorm rounds on `$ARGUMENTS` until ideas deplete (cap 8 rounds), takes the deduplicated inventory as the next-list, fans out one background Agent per item, then self-continues (ScheduleWakeup) round-by-round with plain /cycle semantics — self-feeding from the domain's `## deferred` section — until the domain is DRAINED (open milestones = 0 AND deferred empty AND no other signal). Use when the goal needs width-first exhaustion before parallel execution; /cycle alone derives next-list from current context only (no phase-0 brainstorm).

Engage the `cycle` skill, but precede the next-list step with a **depletion brainstorm**.

1. **Brainstorm depletion (phase 0)** — for `$ARGUMENTS` (or current goal context if empty), run iterative brainstorm rounds. Each round generates ONLY ideas genuinely new vs prior rounds; stop when a new round produces no novel candidates (cap 8 rounds). State the final, deduplicated idea inventory as a numbered bullet list.
2. **Next-list** — take the depleted inventory as the next-list (no re-enumeration). If >8 items, cap at top 8 by impact + state which were deferred.
3. **Dup-race precheck** — same as `/cycle` step 2: for each item that names an INBOX handoff entry (slug/header present in `INBOX.log.md` in the current repo), run the 3-signal grep (A: locate the entry via `grep -niE -A6 '<slug>' INBOX.log.md`, then test its checkbox/status line against the resolved-class regex `(fixed|resolved|closed|landed|shipped|absorbed|superseded|merged|done|✅|🟢|- \[x\])` · B: `gh pr list --state merged --search "<slug>"` · C: `git log --all --grep="<slug>"`). Mark SKIP / PROCEED with reason. Print one judgement line per item.

   **3b. Stale-milestone scan (@D dup_race_precheck scan-B)** — for each open `- [ ]` item, attempt to extract a stable label from the bolded portion (falsifier IDs like `F-FUSION-*`, RFC IDs, slug-shaped tokens). If a label exists, scan `gh pr list --state merged --search "<label>" --limit 3` + `git log --all --oneline --grep="<label>" -n 3` against the same resolved-class regex. On hit: `SKIP STALE — resolved by <PR#>/<sha>` + surface `→ flip [ ] → [x] in <domain>.md at line <N>` (suggestion, not auto-write). Items with no extractable label bypass scan-B (PROCEED).
4. **Parallel-plan** — print compact table `| # | item | subagent_type | iso | resource | goal | precheck |` before dispatch (precheck = `SKIP <reason>` or `PROCEED`). The **resource** column (@D resource_contention) declares the exclusive resource each item touches: `GPU:<host>-timed` (exclusive), `GPU:<host>-any` (non-exclusive), `CPU-only` (default), `Network`, `Filesystem:<repo>`.
   **Pre-fan-out worktree-leak sweep (@D worktree_leak_cleanup)** — between Stage 4 and Stage 5, sweep stale `/tmp/wt-*` linked worktrees (merged-into-main OR age>1h+stale, matching fan-out naming `gpu-*`/`cycle-*`/`<domain>-*`). `git worktree remove <path>` then `git branch -D <branch>`. NEVER touch `/Users/*` worktrees. Print one line per cleanup.

5. **Fan-out** — issue an `Agent` tool call **only for PROCEED rows** (each `run_in_background: true`, `isolation: "worktree"` if it edits code, fully self-contained prompt). SKIP rows do not get an Agent. **Resource-contention serialization (@D resource_contention)** — items sharing an EXCLUSIVE `resource` value issue SEQUENTIALLY (dispatch one, wait for completion, dispatch next); distinct or non-exclusive values fan out CONCURRENTLY. Print `resource-partition: parallel=<N> · serial-chain=[…]` before dispatch.

   **Auto-inject (throttle resilience, @D throttle_resilience)** — every spawned Agent prompt MUST include these two clauses verbatim (copy-paste into the prompt body, near the top):

   - `CHECKPOINT-COMMIT each milestone (after kernel/oracle/measurement) to your worktree branch so a rate-limit death loses no work — run \`git add -A && git commit -m 'wip: <milestone>'\` in your isolated worktree before moving to the next milestone.`
   - `If you hit "Server is temporarily limiting requests (not your usage limit) · Rate limited", wait briefly and resume — the task remains valid; cite the last checkpoint commit SHA when you resume so the parent can see continuity.`

   **Parent-recovery on throttle death** — if the parent observes an Agent died mid-flight on a rate-limit error, re-fire it as a single-agent retry against the SAME worktree branch (the checkpoint commits are replay-safe). Reference pattern: memory `feedback-crash-recovery-artifact-pattern`.

   **Auto-inject (cross-cutting principles, @D principle_injection)** — scan `MEMORY.md` for cross-cutting feedback memories (markers: `ALL 도메인` · `모든 도메인` · `cross-cutting` · `cross-domain` · frontmatter `cross_cutting: true` · body `**Cross-domain principle**:`). Inject UP TO 3 (cap 300 chars each / 1KB total) as a `Cross-cutting principles` block at the top of each spawned prompt. Agent MUST frame verdicts through these lenses (e.g., `% of roofline` not just `ratio vs library X`).
6. **Loop tail — auto-continue to depletion (DEPTH).** Phase 0 (brainstorm) runs ONCE per goal. After the first fan-out, `/cycle-full` is depletion-driving by default: subsequent rounds use plain `/cycle` semantics (no re-brainstorming) — each round self-feeds from open `- [ ]` milestones, else auto-seeds the next batch from the domain's `## deferred` section (Stage 1a PRIMARY signal) — and self-continues until the domain is DRAINED.

   **Depletion test (omit ScheduleWakeup) — only when ALL three hold:** (1) **open milestones = 0** (no `- [ ]` left in the snapshot), AND (2) **`deferred` is empty** (no `## deferred` section, or no still-open backlog item — all promoted + drained), AND (3) **no other seed signal** (user mention · prior-turn `/gap` shortlist · `/check`/`/end` follow-up · `<NAME>.log.md` tail open thread).

   - **NOT yet depleted** (open milestones > 0 OR `deferred` non-empty OR another signal) → the domain is NOT drained. **Self-continue: issue a `ScheduleWakeup` for the next round** (subsequent rounds run plain `/cycle`, no re-brainstorm), and end with:

     ```
     M agents launched (cycle-full · phase 0 brainstorm depleted at round N): <item labels>  [K skipped: <skipped labels with reasons>]

     ⏩ domain not depleted (open: <count> · deferred: <count>) — scheduled next round (plain /cycle, no re-brainstorm).
     ```

   - **$0-RUNNABLE LANE EXHAUSTED** (all three hold) → do NOT ScheduleWakeup. **PAUSE, not "100% done" (@D depletion_not_terminal · `feedback-closure-is-physical-limit`)** — "no cheap runnable task" ≠ "domain complete"; the frontier toward the physical/math limit stays open. End with:

     ```
     M agents launched (cycle-full · phase 0 brainstorm depleted at round N): <item labels>  [K skipped: <skipped labels with reasons>]

     ⏸️ $0-runnable lane exhausted (open milestones 0 · deferred empty · no $0 seed) — loop PAUSES (not 100%-done; frontier toward the physical/math limit stays open). Remaining paths ABOVE the $0 lane: cost-bearing fire · new spec · intractable-limit note · switch: /domain set <other> · close: /end. (Reserve a literal ✅ done ONLY for a finite-scope domain with no open physical-limit frontier.)
     ```

   (The per-round cap throttles WIDTH so each round stays reviewable; the auto-continue marches DEPTH-wise through the whole declared backlog. The user can interrupt at any round.)

Guardrails (per `cycle` SKILL.md): self-enumerate only when next work is genuinely inferable (else ask); disjoint items only; no destructive fan-out; cap >8 with confirm; no nesting; never silently drop a SKIP — always print the precheck reason; auto-continue stops at true depletion (never schedule a wake-up once all three depletion conditions hold).
