# HYPOTHESES — hypothesis-verification system

Pre-register → falsify → run → verdict, for the {{NAME}} problem. A flat registry +
one rich card per hypothesis, with the shared runnable machinery in repo-root `tool/`
(not a local harness).

## Layout

- `REGISTRY.jsonl` — flat registry, one JSON line per hypothesis
  (`{id, slug, tier, title, card, verdict, source, archived, artifacts}`).
- `cards/H_*.md` — one card per hypothesis (frontmatter + body sections).
- `cards/_TEMPLATE.md` — the card skeleton; copy it to start a new hypothesis.

## Method (the discipline that makes a card count)

1. **Pre-register frozen** — write the hypothesis, predictions, variables, and
   **≥5 measurable falsifiers** BEFORE running. Freeze with `frozen_at`.
2. **Falsifiers, not confirmations** — each falsifier is a condition that, if
   true, refutes a component. Include ≥1 negative control and ≥1 bounds check.
3. **Run deterministically** — the run script lives in `state/<hX>_<slug>_<date>/`,
   imports `tool/{{SLUG_SNAKE}}.py`, writes `result.json`, prints a verdict.
4. **Verdict = verbatim stdout** — paste the actual run output into the card.
   No LLM self-judgement (commons verify-done). SUPPORTED only when all
   falsifiers PASS; report FALSIFIED/PARTIAL honestly (commons honesty).
5. **Honest limits ≥3** — where numbers are representative, what the model
   ignores, what would move the result.

## Conventions

- Shared machinery → `tool/{{SLUG_SNAKE}}.py`. Per-hypothesis run + result → `state/`.
- Tier badges in the registry: `🟢 SUPPORTED` · `🟡 PARTIAL` · `🔴 FALSIFIED` ·
  `⚪ PRE-REGISTERED (still-to-run)` · `🜂 ABSTRACT (unverified · falsifiable prediction)`.
- 🜂 ABSTRACT cards (`H_A*`) are imagination/conjecture — a falsifiable prediction but **no run,
  no verdict**, kept tier-separated from the verified `H_0xx` chain (honesty). Promote one to a
  verified `H_0xx` only after it is actually run.
- Update the registry line in lockstep when a card's verdict changes.
